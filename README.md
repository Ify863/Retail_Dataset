 Retail Sales Analysis

 
  This project explores a retail sales dataset containing transaction records across different product categories, customer demographics, and time periods. The dataset was cleaned using Excel, analyzed through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python (Jupyter Notebook), and visualized using Power BI dashboards.
    
     The analysis focuses on:
- Sales trends over time (seasonality and peak periods)
- Product category performance (Electronics, Clothing, Beauty, etc.)
- Customer insights (gender, age distribution, purchase behavior)
- Revenue contribution and quantity sold across categories 

   Objectives
- Explore and understand the structure of the retail dataset
- Identify top-performing and underperforming products
- Analyze sales trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Compare performance across regions and customer demographics
- Reveal seasonal patterns and spending habits
- Support strategic planning and decision-making with data visualizations Dataset Description

The dataset contains 1,000 retail transactions with the following columns:

Column Name       	Description   
Transaction ID    	Unique identifier for each purchase  
Date              	Transaction date                     
| Customer ID       	| Unique identifier for each customer  |
Gender	Customer gender                      
| Age               	Customer age                         
Product Category  	Category of product purchased        
Quantity          	Units purchased
Price per Unit    	Cost of one unit                     
Total Amount      	Total purchase amount
